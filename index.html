<p>The Nebula Award for Best Game Writing is one of the Nebula Awards, presented each year by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Association for science fiction or fantasy game writing. The Nebula Awards have been described as one of "the most important of the American science fiction awards" and "the science-fiction and fantasy equivalent" of the Emmy Awards. The Game Writing category is the newest category of the Nebulas, which were originally awarded in 1966 solely for printed fiction. The Nebula Award for Best Game Writing has been awarded annually since 2019. During the seven nomination years, 41 games by 121 writers have been nominated. These have primarily been video games, but also include eight books for role-playing game systems and an interactive film. Eleven writers have been nominated more than once, with Kate Heartfield, and Natalia Theodoridou having three nominations each. Interactive fiction developer Choice of Games has had the most games nominated with a total of nine over six years. </p>
<p>Silver Certificates are a type of representative money issued between 1878 and 1964 in the United States as part of its circulation of paper currency. They were produced in response to silver agitation by citizens who were angered by the Coinage Act of 1873, which had effectively placed the United States on a gold standard. Since 1968 they have been redeemable only in Federal Reserve Notes and are thus obsolete, but they remain legal tender at their face value and hence are still an accepted form of currency. This five-dollar bill, a 1953 silver certificate bearing the first serial number of a printing of 339,600,000 banknotes, is part of the National Numismatic Collection at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History. It features a portrait of President Abraham Lincoln on the obverse and the facade of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., on the reverse.</p>
