display (Changes the style of the elements (In-line,Block))
nav (Navigation Bar)
ul (Parent of li (ul = unordered list))
li (List just list)

Font(If you want to change the size, or type of text, use font related elements)
Font related elements(font-size, font-weight, font-style, font-family)

Text (If you want to change the position, decoration, or the uppercase lowercase letters, use text related elements)
Text related elements (text-align, text-decoration, text-transform)


When first starting again (Use git clone (the github code link))
then you can open the folder directly from VSC

Box Shaodw: ITS JUST BOX SHADOW NOTHING ELSE (Three values, the first is always the right and left value, Positive numbers = Right and Negative numbers = Left. The second values are always the top and bottom values positive is the bottom and the negatve is always the top, The last value is the blur value, The higher the number the more blurred the shadow is)

Part 3:

Part 5:
Forms
Label: Labels your Inputs (Ex: <Label for="Username">Username</Label>)
Form: I actually dont know what this does. its just like a div for forms
Input: This is basically a textbox (Ex: <input type="password" name= "Password" id="Password" placeholder= "Enter your password">
If you are using input the three neccesary things are type, name, and id, it is recommended that the name and id are the same and the placeholder option is optional)
Options: This makes a dropdown table for your options
