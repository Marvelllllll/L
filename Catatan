list-style (Removes symbols(Between string and numbers))
display (Changes the style of the elements (In-line,Block))
nav (Navigation Bar)
ul (Parent of li (ul = unordered list))
li (List just list)

Font(If you want to change the size, or type of text, use font related elements)
Font related elements(font-size, font-weight, font-style, font-family)
